  <h1>Don't sniff the methane</h1>
  <p>Ever feel like a caged, coal mine canary doomed to sing until the methane does you in?  No? Um, well, it's a metaphor. The point is, sometimes you gotta escape from the drudgery of life to do what you love!</p>
  <p>For me, that means playing and inventing strategy games!  So, I befriended a super cool artist named Justin, and I started Odd Bird Games—a company dedicated to making atypical games that break from the mold.  That doesn’t mean ignoring cherished mechanics like resource management, area control or worker placement! But it does mean spicing things up with a dash of unusual, a pinch of the unexpected and a whole heaping of odd.</p>
  <p>Our first game, Feudum will be offered on Kickstarter in 2016.  Learn more on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or BoardGameGeek.</p>
