	<p>The Kickstarter campaign has come to an end, however, retail editions (at full MSRP) of Feudum and the expansions may be pre-ordered right here!  You may also wait until the summer when the solo variant: Feudum: The Queen's Army will launch on Kickstarter. Rumor has it, there will be some special offers that bundle the base game with expansions! </p>
